🌍 Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation created by mathematician John Conway. It models the life cycle of cells in a grid, evolving based on simple rules. This project implements the Game of Life in Python using the Pygame library, simulating how cells live, die, or reproduce depending on their neighbors.

💻 Project Highlights

Simulates Conway's Game of Life with random initial cell population

Visualizes the grid where live cells are represented as white squares

Allows the simulation to evolve with each frame based on the rules of the game

Adjustable frame rate for controlling the speed of simulation

Cell grid size and window dimensions are customizable

✅ Features Implemented

Random initialization of cells in the grid

Cellular automaton rules:

Cells with fewer than two neighbors die (underpopulation).

Cells with more than three neighbors die (overpopulation).

Dead cells with exactly three neighbors come to life (reproduction).

Real-time grid update and display in a Pygame window

Adjustable frame rate for simulation speed control

⚙️ Tech Stack

🚀 Current Focus

Improving the performance of the simulation and adding interactive controls for pausing, restarting, and adjusting grid settings.
